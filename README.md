Project for Numerical Linear Algebra: QR Factorization with Householder Reflections

In this project, I implement the QR factorization of a matrix A using Householder reflections. Then I use the resulting Q and R matrices to calculate the backward error of the factorization and compare it to the error in sin(pi).

My reference for this project is the book "Numerical Linear Algebra" by Lloyd N. Trefethen and David Bau III.
