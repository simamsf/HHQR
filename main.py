# Project 1: QR Factorization with Householder Reflections
# In this project, we will implement the QR factorization of a matrix A using Householder reflections.
# We will then use the resulting Q and R matrices to calculate the backward error of the factorization and compare it to the error in sin(pi).
# My reference for this project is the book "Numerical Linear Algebra" by Lloyd N. Trefethen and David Bau III.
